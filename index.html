<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> 

Throughout its fifteen year run time from 2005 to 2020 the CW's Supernatural did something not many shows do, they killed their main characters....copious amounts of times. It's almost comical the amount of times this happens though at the same time it's shocking it doesn't happen more often. Throughout the show the brothers face countless threats including demons, vampires, and the literal devil. If you can think of a way to die it's probably happened in the show and there's a likely chance it happened to one of the main characters. Though they usally find some way to resurrect the other so it's not as much of a worrying event compared to other media. 

This website will be a documentation of how these events happen as well as when and what followed.

<h3> The Start: Seasons two - four </h3> 

<p> 
<h4> Season Two </h4>
Season two episode twenty-one <em>"All Hell Breaks Loose: Part One"</em> ends in a way that can only really be described as shocking, the death of the main character. The two episode finale of the second season starts with Sam getting kidnapped to essentially fight to the death along with others. 

This leads to a stressful episode of Dean trying to find his brother and Sam simply trying to survive. At the very end of the episode the show then gives you hope it will all be okay before it gives you the shocking blow of quite literally being stabbed in the back and dying. 

The next episode <em>"All Hell Breaks Loose: Part Two"</em> ends up with Dean selling his soul for his brother's life in a deal with a demon that gives Dean one year to live before he's destined for hell.

<h5> Season Three </h5>
<p>
The first of Dean's deaths happen in season three episode eleven <em>"Mystery Spot"</em>. With Sam trying desperately to find a way to save his brother from his fater they stumble into a time loop made from a character they thought they'd bested already. This "loop" restarts everytime Dean ends up dying shown through the episode in exceedingly strange ways, from getting hit by a car to a piano falling on him. Dean ends up dying approximately a hundered times on a hundered tuesdays and once on a wednesday where he then stays dead for six months. This ends with Sam hunting down the trickster and getting this reversed.

The next death is also Deans with his deal ending at the end of the season. Season three episode sixteen <em>"No Rest for the Wicked"</em> ends with Dean being hunted down and mauled by hellhounds. This dearg is rectified in season for episode one "Lazarus Rising" with Dean being resurrected from death and clawing his way out of his own grave. Later in the episode it's discovered this is done by the angel Castiel who later becomes a recurring and then main character.
